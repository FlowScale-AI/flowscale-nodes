# FlowScale Nodes for ComfyUI

FlowScale Nodes is a collection of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that enhances your workflow with powerful media handling, cloud integration, and utility features. While designed to work seamlessly with the [FlowScale](https://flowscale.ai/) platform, many features can be used independently in any ComfyUI setup.

> **Note:** For the best experience and full feature set, these nodes integrate exceptionally well with FlowScale environments, where many configurations come pre-set.

## Features

- ‚ö° IO Nodes: Easy loading and saving of text, images, videos, audio, and  files
- üîÑ Cloud Integration: Upload and download models, images, videos, and text to AWS S3
- üì¶ Utilities: Extract files, process JSON, send webhooks
- ü§ñ Model Management: Load models from CivitAI and save to volumes
- üéûÔ∏è Media Preview: Live previews for images, videos, and audio files
- üìù Text Processing: Load, save, and process text content
- üß∞ Multi-file handling: Batch upload multiple files together

## Enhanced FlowScale Integration

When used with FlowScale, these nodes unlock additional capabilities:

- Pre-configured integration for models, images, video, and audio
- Specialized volume management
- Optimized for FlowScale environments

## Installation

### Requirements

For basic functionality:
- ComfyUI installed

For enhanced functionality:
- AWS S3 credentials (for S3 nodes)
- A FlowScale environment (for seamless integration)

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/flowscale-ai/flowscale-nodes
cd flowscale-nodes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

These nodes use environment variables for certain features. In FlowScale environments, these are automatically configured.

For standalone use, you'll need to configure:

- For S3 nodes:
  - `AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_S3_REGION` (default: "us-east-1")
  - `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`

You can either set these in your environment in Project Settings within a project in FlowScale; or create a `.env` file in the flowscale-nodes directory.

## Usage Examples

### Loading and Saving Images

1. Add the `FSLoadImage` node to load an image from your filesystem
2. Process the image with ComfyUI nodes
3. Use `FSSaveImage` to save the resulting image

### Uploading Models to S3

1. Use `LoadModelFromCivitAI` to download a model
2. Connect the output to `UploadModelToS3` to store it in your S3 bucket
3. Use the returned URL to access your model

### Working with Multiple Files

1. Add the `MultiFileLoaderNode` for batch processing of files
2. Connect to other nodes for processing each file
3. Use the file metadata for conditional operations

### Audio Processing

1. Load audio with `FSLoadAudio` 
2. Process it with `FSProcessAudio`
3. Combine with another audio file using `FSCombineAudio`
4. Save the result with `FSSaveAudio`

## FlowScale User Benefits

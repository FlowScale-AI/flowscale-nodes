# Video Output Optimization for Flowscale IO Search Endpoint

## Problem
The flowscale io search endpoint was taking too long to return video outputs due to conservative file readiness checks that waited up to 30 seconds with 5-second blocking intervals.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Async File Readiness Check
- **Before**: Used `time.sleep(5)` which blocked the entire event loop
- **After**: Uses `asyncio.sleep()` for non-blocking waits
- **Benefit**: Server can handle other requests while waiting for file readiness

### 2. Dynamic Wait Times Based on File Size
- **Before**: Fixed 30-second wait for all video files
- **After**: Reduces wait time to max 10 seconds for video files > 1MB
- **Benefit**: Faster response for larger, likely complete files

### 3. Faster Check Intervals
- **Before**: 5-second intervals between checks
- **After**: 0.5-1 second intervals with stability verification
- **Benefit**: Quicker detection when files are ready

### 4. File Stability Detection
- **Before**: Only checked if file size changed
- **After**: Monitors both file size AND modification time with consecutive stable checks
- **Benefit**: More reliable detection of file completion

### 5. File Access Caching
- **Before**: Always performed full readiness check
- **After**: Caches recently accessed files for 5 minutes
- **Benefit**: Instant response for files accessed within cache period

### 6. HTTP Range Request Support
- **Before**: Always returned entire video file
- **After**: Supports partial content requests (HTTP 206)
- **Benefit**: Enables progressive video download and seeking

### 7. Enhanced Response Headers
- **Before**: Basic file response
- **After**: Adds caching headers and Accept-Ranges support
- **Benefit**: Better browser caching and video player compatibility

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
1. **First-time video access**: ~50-70% faster (10s vs 30s worst case)
2. **Repeated video access**: ~95% faster (cached responses)
3. **Large video files**: Progressive download starts immediately
4. **Server responsiveness**: No blocking of other requests during file checks

### Configuration Options:
- Cache duration: 5 minutes (configurable via `_cache_max_age`)
- Video file threshold: 1MB for fast-track processing
- Stability checks: 3 consecutive checks for videos, 2 for other files

## Usage Notes:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API
- Automatically detects video file types
- Graceful fallback to original behavior if optimizations fail
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test with various video file sizes
2. Verify range request support with video players
3. Monitor cache hit rates in logs
4. Test concurrent requests during file processing
